## Algorithm Substitution Attack (ASA)
Coze is narrowly concerned with substitution of the value of `alg` itself.  

ASA is more general, where any component of the scheme is substituted for a
malicious version.  Most ASA work appears concerned with primitives/crypto
libraries, not directly relevant to the work of Coze.
