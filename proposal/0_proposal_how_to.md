# How to make a proposal
0. Consider a discussion first on Github.
1. Create a proposal document.
2. Submit a Github issue with the same name.

## Proposal Headers:

Proposals headers should be in this form:

```
# Proposal: Consider using compressed ECDSA
```

Followed by section headers, background, explanation, potential pitfalls, and other expository as needed. 

# Proposal States
When a proposal is rejected, accepted, or otherwise archived:

 - ✅ Good ideas we're generally favorable. 
 - 🤔 Maybe.  We're thinking about this. 
 - ❌ Bad ideas, but they stay here for discussion.
